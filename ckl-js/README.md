# ckl-js

This implements the checkerlang programming language in Javascript.

Checkerlang is used primarily as a programming language to define
checks and statistics in the SDEP project. But it is usable as a
programming language outside of SDEP. For example, it also is
used in the SPLG Grouper software for extension purposes.

Historically, Checkerlang was implemented in C# and .NET Core. Then it
was ported to Java in order to be usable in the SPLG Grouper project.

This project ports Checkerlang to Javascript, allowing exciting new
possibilities. For example, we can provide a browser-based REPL
in which we can experiment with the language and test stuff.
