# checkerlang

This implements the checkerlang programming language.

There are three impelementations available:
* for the javascript platform (browser and/or node.js)
* for the java platform
* for the dotnet platform

The three implementations aim to contain the same functionality
and be compatible. Therefore, it should be possible to write
a checkerlang program in any of these and run it on all the
other platforms.
